				<h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						I'm a software engineer, app developer, and lifelong problem solver based in Kentucky with one arm, 
						a sense of humor, and zero tolerance for bullshit. As a <strong>fair chance hire</strong>, I know what it's like to 
						overcome barriers and prove yourself through your work. Over the years, I've built backend systems at scale, 
						developed mobile apps like <a href="/projects/nudgenote">NudgeNote</a>, and co-led community projects ranging from 
						coding bootcamps to World of Warcraft guilds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether it's writing Ruby code, optimizing workflows, or learning Swift to bring a vision to life, 
						I thrive at the intersection of tech, creativity, and impact. I'm proud to work at <a href="/checkr">Checkr</a>, 
						a company that champions fair chance hiring and helps create opportunities for millions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of work, I'm a metalhead, a mushroom grower, a plant-powered endurance junkie, and eight years clean. 
						I believe in building things that matter, helping others level up, and owning every day I get.

				<h2 class="section-title">Fair Chance Journey</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						As a <strong>fair chance hire</strong>, I've experienced firsthand the transformative power of second chances. 
						My path to tech wasn't traditional. It included overcoming addiction, navigating the justice system, and 
						proving that past mistakes don't define future potential. Eight years clean and counting, I've turned my 
						life around through determination, community support, and a lot of hard work.
					</p>
					<p>
						This journey shapes how I approach everything: with empathy, resilience, and a commitment to helping others 
						who are walking similar paths. Working at Checkr isn't just a job. It's a chance to contribute to a mission 
						that creates opportunities for millions of people like me.

				<h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Most of what I know, I learned by building, breaking, and rebuilding. I've worked my way from a rough start 
						into a full-time engineering role, starting with a coding bootcamp that gave me the foundation to launch my career. 
						Since then, I've continued learning through countless nights of documentation dives and caffeine. 
						I continue to learn daily from app development to AI tooling, fitness science to fungi, and I bring that 
						curiosity into everything I touch.
